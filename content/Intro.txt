Hello! My name is Cody Allen, and I built this website to be a personal portfolio. The further I get into my career the more I learn and the more I experience. 
It becomes too much to put on a one-page resume so this is where I will put everything to give a broader look into who I am as an engineer and how my skills have grown. 
For example, I did not learn to build websites in school, however curiosity got the best of me, and I decided to learn on my own and put this one together.
